#### Commenting Best Practices

1) Keep Comments Updated: Ensure comments reflect the current state of the code.
2) Be Clear and Concise: Write comments that are easy to understand and to the point.
3) Avoid Obvious Comments: Do not comment on self-explanatory code. Focus on explaining complex or non-intuitive parts.
4) Use Comments to Explain Why: Rather than explaining what the code does, focus on explaining why a certain approach was taken.
