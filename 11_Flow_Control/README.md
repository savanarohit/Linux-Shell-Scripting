#### Flow Control

Flow control in Linux shell scripting involves guiding the execution flow of a script based on various conditions.

1. Conditional Statements
```
if-else Statements
```
The if statement tests a condition. If true, it executes a specific block of code.


```
if [ condition ]; then
    # code to execute if condition is true
elif [ another_condition ]; then
    # code to execute if another_condition is true
else
    # code to execute if none of the conditions are true
fi
```
