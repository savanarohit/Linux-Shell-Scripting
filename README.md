### Linux Shell Scripting Basics

Linux shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in the Unix/Linux environment. A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands for a Unix-based operating system's shell to execute. Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in a Linux environment. By using variables, control flow, functions, and input/output redirection, you can create scripts to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently. Always start your scripts with a shebang to specify the interpreter, and use comments to document your code for better readability and maintenance.
